# Miraculous Arc Chart

All the information on arcs, characters, and factions ultimately derives from Nobilis, Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine, and Dr. Jenna Moran's blog posts on the development of both games. I don't own any of the characters or concepts. 
Jenna Moran can be found on <a href="https://afarandasunlessland.wordpress.com">Wordpress</a>. Nobilis, CMWGE, and related materials are available for purchase on <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/4195/Jenna-Katerin-Moran">DriveThruRPG</a>. You should also consider supporting her <a href="https://www.patreon.com/JennaMoran/">Patreon</a>.
